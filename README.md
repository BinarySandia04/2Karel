# 2Karel

## Description

2Karel is a very beautiful game when coders play as a Karel and blablabla. The special thing is that this repo is about Karel in an 3D Unity project with next-gen graphics.

### So what are 2KSetup, 2KInstaller and 2KLauncher?

These are fast-writted Windows Forms C# projects used for downloading the game. The user downloads the 2KSetup.msi, and this downloads the 2KInstaller. I will never update these two programs, because later, 2KInstaller will update 2KLauncher for bugfixing, and other things. And 2KLauncher will download the actual 2Karel game, and thanks to 2KInstaller, I will be able to update 2KLauncher.

If this explanation was a little messy, here's a messy draw:
