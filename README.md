# 2Karel

## Description

2Karel is a very beautiful game when coders play as a Karel and blablabla. The special thing is that this repo is about Karel in an 3D Unity project with next-gen graphics.

## More things about 2Karel!

### What is every folder used by?

- **2KInstaller**: Source code of the 2KInstaller and 2KSetup
- **2KLauncher**: Source code of the 2KLauncher
- **2KarelGame**: Source code of the game (the Unity project)
- **2KarelGameCompiled**: Built 2KarelGame
- **RMfiles**: Files used in this README
- **Releases**: Stable versions of 2KSetup, 2KInstaller, 2KLauncher, the 2KarelGameCompiled (in 2KG.zip) and other files. The launchers download the files directly from this folder, so here there's only stable stuff.

### So what are 2KSetup, 2KInstaller and 2KLauncher?

These are fast-writted Windows Forms C# projects used for downloading the game. The user downloads the 2KSetup.msi, and this downloads the 2KInstaller. I will never update these two programs, because later, 2KInstaller will update 2KLauncher for bugfixing, and other things. And 2KLauncher will download the actual 2Karel game, and thanks to 2KInstaller, I will be able to update 2KLauncher.
