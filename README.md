# 2Karel

## Description

2Karel is a console and gaming computer with next-gen graphics! The game won't be in consoles. Sorry, that was a very sad joke. 2Karel is based on the unknown programming game called Karel.

Now in our local time, this game is typically known in the fun.codelearn.cat website, a programming school. The two first languages that you learn in Codelearn aren't actual programming languages! The second one is a very limited version of JavaScript (adapted for kids. Remember, JavaScript isn't for kids). In this limited version, they learn conditionals and all that kind of stuff.

So I'm making this game because now I work in Codelearn. And I work for them (not really, they don't actually pay me ._.).

This game needs to be finished before **March 2019**, I think that is because in March 2019, starts de *Karel Challenge* competition, I hope I make a conference about this game. I will be very happy! :D. Dreaming is free btw.
