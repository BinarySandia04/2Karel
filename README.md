# 2Karel

## Description

2Karel is a console and gaming computer with next-gen graphics! The game won't be in consoles. Sorry, that was a really sad joke. 2Karel is based on the unknown programming
game called Karel.

Now in our local time, this game is typically known in the fun.codelearn.cat website, a programming school. The two first languages that you learn in
Codelearn aren't actual programming languages! The second one is a very limited version of JavaScript (adapted for kids. Remember, JavaScript is not for kids). In this
limited version, they learn conditionals and all of that stuff.
